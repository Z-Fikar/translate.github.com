  <h2>About Translate House</h2>
  <p>At Translate House we've been developing localization solutions for over
  10 years.  We focus on building software that helps localizers to translate
  and help organizations take their software to new untapped markets.</p>
  <p>Translate House is birthed out of Translate.org.za, a South African
  non-profit that pioneered community localization of products such as
  Firefox and OpenOffice.org into the 11 official languages of South
  Africa.</p>
  <p>Translate House is taking the skills and technology born in
  Translate.org.za and bringing them to the wider world. Our aim is to bring
  them to you and your organization to help you touch more people.</p>
